FPS = 30
Dims = 336*336

0:00 – 0:05
The capsule appears to drift forward without any significant visual change. Pixel intensities remain largely constant, with only a very subtle parallax effect visible. Motion is present but extremely difficult to infer from appearance alone.

0:06 – 0:13
The capsule remains mostly stationary. Bubbles are visible, and around 0:11 a peristaltic contraction occurs, suggesting forward motion. Initially, the motion appears ambiguous and could be interpreted as backward movement. By 0:13, forward movement becomes more visually evident.

0:15
The capsule moves forward again while bubbles remain present. Notably, bubbles appear to disperse as the capsule advances, potentially providing a weak motion cue that a model could exploit.

0:15 – 0:22
The capsule remains largely stationary with minor drift. Visual changes are minimal, making it difficult to reliably determine motion.

0:44 – 1:06
The capsule appears to vibrate in place, likely awaiting the next peristaltic wave. While the background does change subtly (e.g., veins and bubble density), there is no clear forward progression.

1:11
The capsule appears to enter a new region with increased visible space and distinct folds. Prior to this point, the intestinal walls closely surrounded the capsule; here, folds become clearly visible, indicating a possible transition to a different anatomical location.

1:11 – 1:24
Motion through this region is relatively smooth and continuous. Compared to earlier segments with smooth enclosing walls, this region exhibits more folds, though surface color and texture remain consistent.

1:49
A yellow, fluid-like substance enters the field of view. Its origin is unclear. Between 1:49 and 1:58, there is little to no capsule movement, yet the changing appearance of the fluid could be misinterpreted as motion.

2:05
A similar yellow fluid reappears, again introducing significant visual change without clear evidence of camera translation.

2:15
Folds are visible with yellow fluid partially covering the scene.

2:20 – 2:25
The capsule moves through the folded region in a non-smooth manner, characterized by sudden and irregular motion.

2:25 – 2:29
Motion continues similarly to the previous segment, but the presence of yellow fluid masks structural cues, making motion estimation more challenging.

3:27 – 3:54
Red static artifacts appear intermittently on the screen, likely due to sensor or camera faults. These artifacts are unrelated to capsule motion but could easily be misinterpreted as movement by a model.

4:17
Within the yellow fluid, small solid particles are visible moving independently, even when the capsule itself appears stationary or drifting. This could be confused with actual camera motion.

4:50
Forward motion is present but difficult to perceive due to minimal changes in edges and consistent lighting. Unlike earlier segments, there are no visible contractions or prominent folds to aid motion perception.

6:53
Motion becomes erratic and difficult to interpret. The direction of movement is unclear, and bubbles obscure the scene. In such cases, motion cues are primarily inferred from changes near the image boundaries or subtle fold movement.

8:30 
A large bubble forms, allowing partial visibility through it and suggesting a larger opening ahead. From this point onward, the scene appears more fluid-dominated, with increased yellow liquid coating the walls. This may indicate a change in anatomical context.

11:22 - 12:15 
Motion is highly ambiguous. The capsule appears to move back and forth, but upon closer inspection, this may represent continuous motion without distinct pauses, giving the illusion of stagnation.

Sidenote
Openings are frequently coated with liquid, producing reflective surfaces. These reflections may introduce misleading visual cues but could potentially be informative if modeled correctly.

14:00
The yellow liquid becomes noticeably grainier, a change that appears to begin slightly earlier and increases over time.

15:00
The lumen opening becomes wider, and capsule traversal appears easier, with fewer obstructions.

15:37
The opening remains wide, but folds are now visible around the edges. These folds provide clearer structural cues, and motion through this region appears smoother, with fewer prolonged stationary intervals. 

17:57
Motion becomes irregular again, with sudden changes that make it difficult to infer consistent movement.

18:27
The liquid coating the scene transitions to a greenish hue, indicating a further change in visual conditions.
