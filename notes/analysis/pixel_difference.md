Pixel Difference Analysis

Video ID: 2f513ad4ee5e4630
Frame sampling rate: 2 FPS
Signal: Mean absolute pixel difference between consecutive frames


Time-aligned Observations and Signal Behavior
0:00 – 0:05

The pixel-difference signal exhibits multiple spikes during this interval. Notably, the signal reaches a local minimum around 0:03 (≈ 8.04) and then increases steadily until approximately 0:05.5, with a maximum intensity of ≈ 24.56.
This behavior contrasts with qualitative observations, where the capsule appears to drift forward with minimal visual change, indicating that pixel difference does not reliably encode smooth forward motion.

0:11

During the peristaltic contraction noted qualitatively, the pixel-difference signal shows a downward trend from approximately 20 to 8.97 between 0:11 and 0:13.5.
Despite an apparent physical contraction and inferred motion, the signal decreases, suggesting that pixel difference may underestimate motion during non-rigid tissue deformation.

0:14 – 0:15

An upward slope is observed in the signal (≈ 8.97 → 17.7), coinciding with visible bubble movement that aided manual motion inference.
This suggests that the pixel-difference signal is highly sensitive to bubble dynamics rather than to camera translation itself.

0:15 – 0:22

While qualitative notes indicate relative stationarity with minor drift, the signal shows a spiky downward trend until approximately 0:24.5, followed by a sudden increase near 0:25.
This inconsistency highlights the difficulty of interpreting motion state from the signal alone.

0:44 – 1:06

The pixel-difference signal remains relatively stable with no major spikes.
This aligns well with qualitative observations where the capsule appeared to vibrate in place without clear forward progression, indicating a rare case where pixel difference and perceived motion agree.

1:09 and 1:11

Two large spikes are observed at these timestamps (≈ 69.81 and ≈ 47.2 respectively).
These coincide with the capsule entering a new region with visible folds at approximately 1:11, suggesting that abrupt structural changes strongly influence pixel difference.

1:18

The signal reaches its lowest value observed thus far (≈ 4.93).
Despite ongoing motion in this region, pixel difference collapses, reinforcing the notion that homogeneous textures suppress the signal.

1:11 – 1:24

The signal exhibits continuous spiking throughout this interval, consistent with qualitative observations of smooth but sustained motion. However, elevated activity persists until approximately 1:45, extending beyond the visually identified region.
This suggests temporal smearing, where pixel difference remains high even after the underlying motion regime changes.

1:45

A sharp increase in signal is observed between 1:45 and 1:47.
Qualitative notes identify the appearance of yellow fluid at approximately 1:49, indicating that the signal likely responds early to fluid-induced appearance changes rather than to camera motion itself.

2:05

A noticeable spike occurs at this timestamp, aligning with the reappearance of yellow fluid as described in the qualitative notes.

2:10 – 2:15

Large upward spikes are present, coinciding with increased visibility of folds.
This suggests that structural complexity, rather than smooth motion, dominates the pixel-difference response.

2:20 – 2:25

Qualitatively, motion during this interval is described as non-smooth and irregular. However, the signal shows only moderate variation (≈ 12.7–20.3), failing to capture the perceived instability of motion.

2:25 – 2:29

The signal follows a smooth downward trend.
This contradicts qualitative observations where fluid masking made motion estimation difficult, indicating that the signal may falsely suggest stability.

3:27 – 3:54

A small spike appears around 3:27, corresponding to the onset of red static artifacts. The largest spike in this interval occurs around 3:36.
These changes are unrelated to camera motion, demonstrating susceptibility of pixel difference to sensor noise.

4:17

A sudden drop in signal is observed (≈ 3.68).
Qualitative notes indicate the presence of solid particles moving within fluid at this time, reinforcing that pixel difference does not consistently reflect meaningful motion cues.

4:50

Despite qualitative confirmation of forward motion, the signal shows minimal spiking.
From the pixel-difference plot alone, motion at this timestamp would be difficult to infer.

6:53

Although motion is described as erratic in the qualitative notes, the signal exhibits spikes comparable to those present throughout the video.
This indicates that pixel difference does not uniquely characterize erratic or unstable motion.

8:30

A downward spike is observed (≈ 9.32).
While a large bubble and increased lumen opening are visible qualitatively, the signal does not distinctly capture this structural transition.

11:22 – 12:15

Both qualitative observations and the signal indicate ambiguous motion.
The pixel-difference signal remains relatively stable (≈ 7.4–11.6), with a single spike near 12:02. This consistency reflects uncertainty rather than clear motion cues.

14:00

The qualitative observation of increasingly grainy yellow fluid is not reflected in any distinctive signal pattern.
This suggests that certain appearance changes are not reliably encoded by pixel difference.

15:00

A clear spike is observed (≈ 37.67), following a period of relatively low signal values.
This indicates a significant appearance change but does not directly reveal the nature of the underlying motion.

17:57

The signal rises sharply from approximately 4 to 20.
While a change is clearly detected, the direction and stability of motion cannot be inferred from the signal alone.

18:27

A sudden surge in signal is observed, potentially corresponding to the transition of fluid color to green.
This reinforces the sensitivity of pixel difference to color and appearance changes rather than to physical displacement.
