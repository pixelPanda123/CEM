0:00 – 0:05

Between 0:00 and 0:01, the embedding distance increases from approximately 6 to 13 (a change of ~7 units). However, qualitative notes indicate only slight forward drift with minimal visual change. At approximately 0:03, the embedding distance decreases again to ~6.4, followed by another increase to ~13.5 at 0:05. This oscillatory pattern suggests minor viewpoint fluctuations or to-and-fro motion rather than sustained, significant translation. Overall, this interval reflects subtle scene changes consistent with weak parallax rather than clear forward motion.

0:06 – 0:13

At 0:06, the embedding distance is approximately 9.66, with values ranging between a minimum of ~5.78 and a maximum of ~12.33 during this interval. No pronounced peaks are observed, indicating the absence of major scene transitions. This aligns with qualitative observations describing the capsule as largely stationary, with no significant structural or visual changes.

~0:14.6

A prominent spike appears around 0:14.6 relative to its immediate surroundings. This coincides with qualitative notes indicating the onset of perceptible motion at approximately 0:15, suggesting a notable scene change at this point.

0:15 – 0:22

A spike is observed around 0:20; however, qualitative notes describe this interval as largely stationary, with motion being barely perceptible. This indicates that the embedding representation still responds to minor visual changes even when physical motion is minimal, highlighting a limitation in directly mapping embedding distance to motion magnitude.

0:44 – 1:06

The embedding distance remains relatively stable throughout this interval, with no large spikes. This is consistent with qualitative notes describing the capsule as stationary or vibrating in place. A minor discrepancy around 1:05 may be attributable to imprecision in manual timestamp annotation rather than a true representational anomaly.

1:09.6

A pronounced spike is observed at approximately 1:09.6, reaching an embedding distance of ~20.3, the largest encountered thus far. This aligns with qualitative observations indicating that the capsule enters a new anatomical region, suggesting a significant scene transition.

1:11 – 1:24

This interval is characterized primarily by downward fluctuations, indicating relatively small frame-to-frame representational changes. An occasional upward spike is present but not dominant. Qualitative notes describe motion here as smooth and continuous; the embedding behavior is consistent with gradual progression through a visually similar region, without abrupt scene changes.

1:49

No large spike is observed at this timestamp despite qualitative notes describing the appearance of yellow liquid. Instead, a noticeable plateau is present, a pattern also observed in the optical flow analysis. This suggests a change in visual composition that is gradual rather than abrupt.

2:05

A clearer spike is present at this point, in contrast to the more subdued response at 1:49. This may indicate a stronger or more sudden visual change associated with the yellow liquid or surrounding structures.

2:11

A large upward spike (~19.6) is observed, the most prominent since the major transition at ~1:09. This suggests another significant scene change, potentially related to increased structural complexity or altered viewpoint.

Sidenote: From approximately 1:45 onward, the signal becomes less stable, exhibiting more abrupt upward spikes interspersed with valleys. This indicates a shift toward more irregular scene changes.

2:20 – 2:29

The embedding distance shows irregular upward spikes and frequent valleys, suggesting uneven or unstable motion. This aligns with qualitative notes describing non-smooth movement during this interval.

2:40 – 3:10

The signal becomes more stable again, with fewer extreme fluctuations. This may correspond to reduced motion or traversal through a visually homogeneous region with limited scene change.

3:27 – 3:54

A noticeable upward spike occurs at approximately 3:27, which may correspond to the onset of red static artifacts. Between 3:30 and 3:50, several sharp spikes are observed. Due to the presence of visual artifacts, it is difficult to determine whether these changes arise from true capsule motion or sensor noise.

4:17

A deep valley is observed at approximately 4:17, followed by a sharp increase to ~14.2 at around 4:19. This pattern is consistent with qualitative notes describing the appearance of solid particles within yellow fluid, indicating a transient but notable change in scene composition.

4:50

The signal exhibits regular fluctuations during this period. This could reflect either stable forward motion with minimal visual variation or low-amplitude drift. While qualitative notes describe forward motion, the embedding signal alone does not provide sufficient evidence to distinguish between these possibilities.

6:53

Qualitative notes describe motion as erratic. The embedding distance shows frequent changes at nearly every frame, with fluctuations remaining within a bounded range. This suggests continuous scene evolution with significant viewpoint instability, consistent with irregular motion.

8:30

A downward spike is observed at this timestamp, accompanied by smaller peaks on either side. This pattern suggests that the embedding captures a localized scene change, potentially corresponding to the presence of bubbles, as noted qualitatively.

11:22 – 12:15

The signal remains relatively stable during this interval, with regular peaks and troughs confined to a limited range (~7–12). This oscillatory behavior suggests to-and-fro or minor viewpoint changes. Qualitative observations also indicate ambiguity regarding whether the capsule is moving forward or remaining in place.

14:00

Significant spikes begin to appear from approximately 13:45 onward. This may correspond to the qualitative observation of increasingly grainy liquid, which would alter scene appearance and thus the embedding representation.

15:00

The embedding distance exhibits larger and more regular peaks, indicating more periodic scene changes. While this could be consistent with forward motion, it may also reflect rotational or oscillatory movement. Directional interpretation is not possible from the embedding distance alone.

17:57

The signal becomes more irregular, with downward fluctuations varying in magnitude across frames. This suggests increased instability in scene evolution, consistent with qualitative notes describing irregular motion at this stage.
