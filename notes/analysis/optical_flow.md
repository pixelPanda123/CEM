Time-aligned Observations and Signal Behavior

0:00 – 0:05

The optical flow signal exhibits a smooth upward trend between approximately 0:03 and 0:05.46.
Qualitatively, no clear capsule translation is observed in this interval, aside from very subtle parallax. This indicates that optical flow responds to minor appearance changes even when macroscopic motion is minimal, potentially overestimating motion in near-stationary conditions.


0:06 – 0:13

Despite qualitative observations describing the capsule as mostly stationary, a large downward spike is observed around 0:08–0:08.58 (≈ 14 → 5.36). Another downward spike occurs near 0:11, coinciding with a peristaltic contraction.
Rather than indicating reduced motion, these drops likely reflect transient alignment of frames during tissue deformation, suggesting that optical flow magnitude is not monotonic with perceived physical activity.

0:15

Qualitative notes indicate forward capsule movement at this timestamp; however, no prominent spikes are visible in the optical flow signal. A modest upward change between approximately 0:13.5 and 0:15 may correspond to this motion, but the response is weak.
This suggests that smooth forward translation in visually homogeneous regions produces limited optical flow response.

0:15 – 0:22

A downward spike is present around this timestamp, while qualitative notes describe the scene as stable.
Rather than indicating annotation error, this discrepancy suggests that optical flow is sensitive to subtle local intensity changes or noise that are not perceived as motion by a human observer.

1:08
The largest spike observed thus far occurs at this timestamp.
This aligns well with qualitative observations indicating that the capsule enters a new anatomical region, confirming that optical flow strongly responds to abrupt structural transitions.

1:11 – 1:24

The signal contains frequent spikes with magnitudes ranging approximately from 2.4 to 12. These spikes appear quasi-periodic.
This behavior is consistent with sustained motion through a folded region, although the periodicity likely reflects repetitive tissue geometry rather than consistent forward translation.

1:49

Only minimal variation is observed in the optical flow signal.
Given qualitative notes describing the appearance of yellow fluid without clear capsule movement, the signal correctly fails to indicate motion but also cannot distinguish between stationarity and visually dynamic fluid motion.

2:05

Similarly, the signal shows little variation, reinforcing that optical flow does not reliably capture motion in fluid-dominated scenes.

2:11 – 2:16

An upward growth in spike magnitude is observed during this interval.
This aligns with qualitative observations of increased fold visibility, suggesting that optical flow is driven primarily by structural complexity rather than by motion smoothness or direction.

2:20 – 2:25

Large spikes are present; however, their magnitude and distribution do not clearly reflect the irregular, non-smooth motion described qualitatively.
While motion is detected, the signal does not encode motion instability in a discriminative way.

3:27 – 3:54

A noticeable valley at approximately 3:27 is followed by a sudden increase in spike magnitude.
Qualitative notes identify red static artifacts in this region, indicating that optical flow responds to sensor noise and artifacts rather than true capsule motion.

4:17

A slight upward trend is observed between 4:17 and 4:18 (≈ 1 → 5).
Qualitative notes describe the presence of independently moving particles within fluid, suggesting that optical flow captures particle motion rather than camera motion.

4:50

Between 4:40 and 4:50, the signal is nearly flat, indicating minimal inferred motion.
At exactly 4:50, a small upward spike occurs, coinciding with qualitative notes that forward motion is present but visually difficult to perceive. This again suggests limited sensitivity to smooth, low-texture motion.

6:53

Spike patterns around this timestamp are similar to surrounding regions.
Despite qualitative descriptions of erratic motion, the optical flow signal does not uniquely characterize instability or irregularity, limiting its descriptive power.

8:30

A downward spike is observed at 8:30.
However, its magnitude is not distinct from other downward fluctuations. Given qualitative notes describing large bubbles, this change is more likely attributable to bubble dynamics than to capsule motion.

11:22 – 12:15

The signal exhibits regular fluctuations within a relatively narrow range (≈ 1.85–8.5).
Both qualitative and quantitative analyses suggest ambiguous motion during this period, with no strong evidence of sustained translation.

14:00

Spikes are present but do not convey new information beyond general appearance change.
Color transitions and fluid texture changes observed qualitatively are not reliably distinguishable in the optical flow magnitude signal.

15:00

The signal becomes smoother, with spikes clustered closely and exhibiting similar magnitudes.
This may reflect more consistent structural context rather than a meaningful change in motion dynamics.

17:57 – 18:00

A pronounced spike is observed around 18:00 (≈ 14.37), exceeding surrounding values.
This likely corresponds to a change in motion or scene configuration, although the signal alone does not specify the nature of the change.

19:38

A clear shift in signal distribution occurs.
Previously, spikes peaked around ≈ 8.44; after this point, values increase to a minimum of approximately 15. No qualitative notes were recorded for this interval, indicating a candidate region for further inspection and potential missed annotation.
